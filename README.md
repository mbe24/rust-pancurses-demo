# Rust pancurses demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mbe24/rust-pancurses-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mbe24/rust-pancurses-demo)
Example of rust with pancurses

Rust uses Cargo for building and managing dependencies.

## Usage

```
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
Since `cargo run` also performs a build, the first command can be left out.
